# Movie-ticket-Booking-system
The project aims at developing a simulation tool depicting how a movie ticket is booked

Guys we'll first start with making changes to the following functions-
a. int changeprice() to make price changes for ticket.
b. int choice1() to make additional design for the ticket.
c. void ticket() in order to add additional features to ticket
d. int movie() to add 10 more movies
e. Repeat step c. for ticket2 and ticket3 functions as well
